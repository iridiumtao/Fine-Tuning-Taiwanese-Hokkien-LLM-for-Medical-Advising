    "\n",
    "We’ll focus especially on data sources, resources, outputs, and variables. Here’s an example of a Terraform configuration that includes all four:\n",
    "\n",
    "    resource \"openstack_compute_instance_v2\" \"my_vm\" {\n",
    "      name            = \"${var.instance_hostname}\"\n",

    "\n",
    "    variable \"instance_hostname\" {\n",
    "      description = \"Hostname to use for the image\"\n",
    "      type        = string\n",
    "      default     = \"example-vm\"\n",
    "    }\n",
    "\n",
    "    output \"instance_ip\" {\n",
    "      value = openstack_compute_instance_v2.my_vm.access_ip_v4\n",
    "    }\n",
    "\n",
    "Each item is in a **stanza** which has a block type, an identifier, and a body enclosed in curly braces {}. For example, the resource stanza for the OpenStack instance above has the block type `resource`, the resource type `openstack_compute_instance_v2`, and the name `my_vm`. (This name can be anything you want - it is used to refer to the resource elsewhere in the configuration.) Inside the body, we would specify attributes such as `flavor_name`, `image_id`, and `network` (you can see a complete list in the [documentation](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/terraform-provider-openstack/openstack/latest/docs/resources/compute_instance_v2)).\n",
    "\n",
    "The data sources, variables, and resources are used to define and manage infrastructure.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **data** sources get existing infrastructure details from OpenStack about resources *not* managed by Terraform, e.g. available images or flavors. For example, here we had a data stanza of type “openstack_images_image_v2” with name “ubuntu”. Terraform will get the details of this image from the OpenStack provider; then, when we use `data.openstack_images_image_v2.ubuntu.id` in defining the resource, it knows the ID of the image without us having to look it up. (Note that we can refer to another part of the Terraform file using `block_type.resource_type.name`, e.g. `data.openstack_images_image_v2.ubuntu` here.) You can look at our `data.tf` and see that we are asking Terraform to find out about the existing `sharednet1` network, its associated subnet, and several security groups.\n",
    "-   **variables** let us define inputs and reuse the configuration across different environments. The value of variables can be passed in the command line arguments when we run a `terraform` command, or by defining environment variables that start with `TF_VAR`. In this example, there’s a variable `instance_hostname` so that we can re-use this configuration to create a VM with any hostname - the variable is used inside the resource block with `name = \"${var.instance_hostname}\"`. If you look at our `variables.tf`, you can see that we’ll use variables to define a suffix to include in all our resource names (e.g. your net ID), and the name of your key pair.\n",
    "-   **resources** represent actual OpenStack components such as compute instances, networks, ports, floating IPs, and security groups. You can see the types of resources available in the [documentation](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/terraform-provider-openstack/openstack/latest/docs). Our resoures are defined in `main.tf`.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may notice the use of `for_each` in `main.tf`. This is used to iterate over a collection, such as a map variable, to create multiple instances of a resource. Since `for_each` assigns unique keys to each element, that makes it easier to reference specific resources. For example, we provision a port on `sharednet1` for each instance, but when we assign a floating IP, we can specifically refer to the port for “node1” with `openstack_networking_port_v2.sharednet1_ports[\"node1\"].id`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Terraform also supports outputs, which provide information about the infrastructure after deployment. For example, if we want to print a dynamically assigned floating IP after the infrastructure is deployed, we might put it in an output. This will save us from having to look it up in the Horizon GUI. You can see in `outputs.tf` that we do exactly this.\n",
    "\n",
    "Terraform is *declarative*, not imperative, so we don’t need to write the exact steps needed to provision this infrastructure - Terraform will examine our configuration and figure out a plan to realize it."
